Why Blheli_S ESC? Advantages Better Low RPM performance Relatively cheap for driving BLDC motors Compact and Lightweight Highly configurable with esc-configurator Disadvantages They don't have inbuilt BEC Initial configuration is required Requires a Flight controller or Arduino for configuration How to configure Blheli_S? Blheli_S esc can be configured using esc-configurator Additional hardware required Arduino (UNO or Nano) or Flight controller can be used as programmer Flight controller - works directly with betaflight firmware, no additional flashing required Arduino guide - use Arduino as ESC programmer Firmware settings Since Blheli_S was originally designed for Quads and Helis, we have to change some settings before using them in our models Motor direction - Set to Bi-directional mode Startup power - Start with a low value, then increase as necessary. Low RPM protection - Disable Demag compensation - This is a safety feature, The ESC will cutoff power to motor if the motor is stalled. To be set to LOW Motor timing - Powering other electronics Blheli_S ESC don't have inbuilt BEC like the crawler ESCs You have to buy a BEC to power the RX receiver and Servos. Alternatively, You can also use a 5V buck convertor (less than $3).","title":"Blheli_S ESC"},{"location":"blheli/#blheli_s-esc","text":"This guide will be focused on setting up Blheli_S, since it is the recommended ESC for our RC models.","title":"Blheli_S ESC"},{"location":"blheli/#why-blheli_s-esc","text":"","title":"Why Blheli_S ESC?"},{"location":"blheli/#advantages","text":"Better Low RPM performance Relatively cheap for driving BLDC motors Compact and Lightweight Highly configurable with esc-configurator","title":"Advantages"},{"location":"blheli/#disadvantages","text":"They don't have inbuilt BEC Initial configuration is required Requires a Flight controller or Arduino for configuration","title":"Disadvantages"},{"location":"blheli/#how-to-configure-blheli_s","text":"Blheli_S esc can be configured using esc-configurator","title":"How to configure Blheli_S?"},{"location":"blheli/#additional-hardware-required","text":"Arduino (UNO or Nano) or Flight controller can be used as programmer Flight controller - works directly with betaflight firmware, no additional flashing required Arduino guide - use Arduino as ESC programmer","title":"Additional hardware required"},{"location":"blheli/#firmware-settings","text":"Since Blheli_S was originally designed for Quads and Helis, we have to change some settings before using them in our models Motor direction - Set to Bi-directional mode Startup power - Start with a low value, then increase as necessary.
