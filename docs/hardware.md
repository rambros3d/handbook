Most of our RC scale models use BLDC motors (especially A2212 motor). Here's some extra info about the motors

## 1.Motors
### A2212 Motor
The models numbers can be confusing since **2212 and 2826** are basically the **same motor**.

* **2212** - This is stator size of the motor (22mm diameter x 12mm height)
* **2826** - This is casing size of the motor (28mm diameter x 26mm height)

## 2.ESC
A suitable ESC would be required for the BLDC motors.
**20A ESC** would be suited for a A2212 motor. Blheli_S is the preferred choice for our models.

## 3.Servo motor
For the servo, you can use any 9g servo. Even the common Blue servos will work fine.
I recommended MG90S servo, they have better build quality and work smoothly.
