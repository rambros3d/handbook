## Slicer
Recommended Slicer : **Cura - [Download latest](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura
)**

### Why Cura?

**Advantages:**

* Supports and Rafts are very clean (This is the main reason I use Cura)
* Interface is simple
* Wide range of Plugins available

**Disadvantages:**

* Slow startup - fix with [Startup Optimizer](https://marketplace.ultimaker.com/app/cura/plugins/fieldofview/StartOptimiser)
* Pause at height feature is not straightforward - [more info](https://all3dp.com/2/cura-pause-at-height-how-to-do-it/)

### Other Slicers
You can also use these slicers if they work well for you, but I switched to Cura since its better with supports and rafts.

* Superslicer - best support for Klipper firmware - [Download](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/releases/latest)
* Prusaslicer - [Download](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/latest)

Initially small parts like gears printed well only with Cura. In late 2022 that was fixed when Prusa/SuperSlicer switched to Arachne engine. Hopefully they fix the supports issue too.
